# CS4 Mainline Curated Resources
> Complete list of curated resources for parents, students and mentors. 

Welcome! You've taken a step towards a brighter future by signing up for the CS4 Mainline Bootcamp! Below you'll find the homework assignments that will be required to be complete for the following session. You can also find resources for specific tracks if you are a more advanced student. See you soon!

## [Day 3](https://codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/scratch/ghostbusters/)
## Introduction:
In this project, children will learn how to use variables to store data in their programs.
## Resources
For this project, Scratch 2 should be used. Scratch 2 can either be used online at jumpto.cc/scratch-on or can be downloaded from jumpto.cc/scratch-off and used offline.

You can find a completed version of this project online, or it can be downloaded by clicking the ‘Project Materials’ link for this project, which contains:

Ghostbusters.sb2
Learning Objectives

Variables;
Random numbers.

# [Day 2 Assignment](https://codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/scratch/lost-in-space/)
## Introduction:
In this project, children will learn how to combine code blocks to create a simple animation.

Resources
For this project, Scratch 2 should be used. Scratch 2 can either be used online at jumpto.cc/scratch-on or can be downloaded from jumpto.cc/scratch-off and used offline.

You can find a completed version of this project online, or it can be downloaded by clicking the ‘Project Materials’ link for this project, which contains:

Learning Objectives

Loops:
Repeat loops;
Forever loops.
This project covers elements from the following strands of the Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum:

Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs.
Challenges

“Improving your animation” - altering the numbers in a short program;
“Make your own animation” - applying the learning to make a new animation.

# [Day 1 Assignment](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/rock-band) 
> In class, we covered Activity 1 of our curriculum. At home, you'll be working on building a Scratch project from ground up. Make sure to let us know in class tomorrow in the beginning if you get stuck so we can go over the homework. 
Our partners over at [code club](http://projects.codeclubworld.org/index.html) gave us projects for us to use in our curriculum. 
## Rock Band
### Introduction:
In this project, children will learn how to add sound and music to their projects, as well as changing and
programming sprite costumes.
### Resources
For this project, Scratch 2 should be used. Scratch 2 can used online at jumpto.cc/scratch-on. Use the login give to you in class! Text (484)-324-8539 if you need help!
### Learning Objectives
* Sprites;
* Costumes;
* Sequential code blocks;
* Events;
* Sound and music.
### Additional Challenges
* “Improving your drum” - Changing sprite sounds and adding events;
* “Changing your singer’s costume” - adding and controlling sprite costumes;
* “Make your own band” - using the skills learnt to create new instruments.

## Scratch
> Here you can find additional resources for MIT's Scratch. 

### Beginner // Intermediate Scratch
> You've got these! With rigorous preparation in class, you should be able to handle these projects below if you are starting out. 

#### [Scratch Programming Projects by Nebo](http://nebomusic.net/advancedscratch.html)
> Over 5+ projects you can build using Scratch. 

#### Intermediate: [Code Club](http://projects.codeclubworld.org/en-GB/02_scratch_02/)
> These step - by - step instructions go - over intermediate Scratch Projects. 

### Advanced Scratch
> These projects are tough. We'd encourage you to come to these once you've completed the Google CS program and the intermediate projects above, and have time to work on these in class. You can also work on these projects at home to challenge yourself and get a chance at "Student of the Week" or a "Great Job" certificates. 

#### [Scratch Programming Projects by Nebo](http://nebomusic.net/advancedscratch.html)
> These are some high - level projects that you can work on to challenge yourself in Scratch.

Jump right into these if you've completed the previously assigned projects.
